# Data Warehouse Developer Notes

Notes taken while working on the AAPB-Brandeis datahousing server. Some of these notes probably fit better in other repositories, and some are more like loose thoughts that are not relevant anymore (needs some cleanup).

## Installation

For local install see the end of the README file. Basically: (1) install requirements, (2) copy `.env.sample` into `.env` and edit as needed. The code uses dotenv.load_dotenv() to set variables in os.environ.

Start the server with `flask run`.

To populate a database with all the files in the assets (as defined by ASSET\_DIR in `.env`) you should set BUILD\_DB to 1 and restart the server. It will then load all file paths. Set BUILD_DB back to 0 for your next run otherwise the database will be recreated every time you start the server.

> TODO: would like to change the startup/setup so that you do not have to set and reset the BUILD\_DB variable.


## Other comments


### Benchmarking

Loading all MMIF files from the main branch in aapb-evalualtion (about 1400, for 243Mb) took about 6 minutes.


### Automatic garbage collection

> "Given the power of rewind, we can always delete any intermediate MMIF, and keep only the files in the terminal subdirectory."

My suggestion is to not bother about this till until we know how much redundancy we are talking about. See [issue #19](https://github.com/clamsproject/aapb-brandeis-datahousing/issues/19).


### More

Return values are a bit mixed, sometimes a json structure, sometimes a string (which is JSON, but you get the point).


### Wrong links to file

When searching on;

| field | value |
| ----- | ------|
|GUID | cpb-aacip-525-028pc2v94s |
|Pipeline | {"chyron-detection/v1.0": {}}|

You get a full URL in for one file:

```
<a href="view_mmif.html?mode=parameters&path=/Users/Shared/aapb/mmif-storage-251016/chyron-detection/v1.0/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e/cpb-aacip-525-028pc2v94s.mmif">
```

But if you do not include the GUID you get a list, which includes the same file but now the link is

```
<a href="view_mmif.html?mode=parameters&path=chyron-detection/v1.0/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e/cpb-aacip-525-028pc2v94s.mmif">```

ANd then clicking it fails. Standardize on the second throughout.
